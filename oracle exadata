Exadata Database Machine includes all the hardware needed to run Oracle Database.
The database servers, storage servers and network are preconfigured, pretuned and pretested by Oracle engineers, eliminating the weeks of effort typically required to deploy a high performance system. 
Extensive end-to-end testing ensures all components work together and there are no performance bottlenecks or single points of failure that can affect the complete system. 
Exadata Database Machine also includes the Oracle Exadata System Software, which runs on both database servers and storage servers.
Unique software algorithms in Oracle Exadata System Software implement database intelligence in storage, PCI-based flash, and the RDMA Network Fabric network to deliver higher performance and high capacity at lower costs than other platforms.
